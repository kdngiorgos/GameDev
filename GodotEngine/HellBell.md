# Narrative

Bell was a girl born in the 2000s. Her life from early on is scarred by her parents. Her parents are struggling with demons of their own.

Her father is strict and has a lot of expectations from her, he doesn't yell at her but is always passive aggressive and expresses his disappointment every time Bell fails at something, small or big. At least that's the way she felt and maybe that was the reason of why she second guesses her actions and doesn't like taking risks. 
Her father was the root of her **ANXIETY** in her teen years due to fear of failure and disappointing him. He also made her have insecurities about her **BODY** weight (BODY DYSMORPHIA).

Her mother was always kind and relaxed, but a bit lost, and Bell would always wonder if that is actually her mothers personality or the results for her psychosis/schizophrenia meds.. Bell loved her mother but felt a bit sorry for her mental illness. When Bell was in high-school her mother took her own life, and Bell didn't really accept that and acted like it didn't affect her for a long time.
This trouble made her fall into **ADDICTIONS** in order to escape her thoughts and her mother's genes meant that Bell would later inherit **SCHIZOPHRENIA** (Hearing voices \ hallucinations) as well

Bell was an artistic child, that growing up would spend time Drawing and Dancing and she wanted to become a dancer. She never tried pursuing it though as it meant disappointment and uncertainty in her father's eyes, and her not being comfortable with her body didn't help much. Unfortunately was a shy kid, without many friends, and her father being himself she didn't have anyone to express herself to. So all of her problems were shut down and not even thought after.
The first battle that she had to face was a strong one, and of course she wasn't ready to face the death of her mother, so her brain kept it a secret from her. You could almost see this cloudy, misty place in her mind that was locked off from the other part, like a dark place no one has access to.

In college she had a hard time with **ANXIETY** for her studies and personal life. It made her quit whatever she was doing for herself and focus solely on her studies and career, thinking this was the key to the life she wanted. Later a friend from college, Pete, offered her an escape to help her relax, they would smoke weed together for the first time, which was relieving indeed. In college Bell and Pete got close and later got into a relationship. Bell for the first time had someone that she trusted, loved and cared for.
Over the next years they would smoke weed more and more frequently, Pete was her best friend and lover, the only one that cared for her and could accept her the way she was. 

Graduation led to a bunch of challenges. She had to now find a full-time job and support herself financially, she now needs to take care of herself. That's where an **ADDICTION** would spawn, she would smoke weed with Pete every day at night, knowing it wasn't good for her, but quitting would mean having to battle anxiety and address her current growing problems, since she felt she needed to make a change in her life. Around this time Bell started experiencing memory loss and mild hallucinations but didn't think much of it.

Ultimately she did take an altering decision, she moved abroad, tried her luck elsewhere and pursued becoming a dancer, somewhere she can define her new self and not get shaped by other people's images of her. Since her world meant facing people, habits and problems of the past, she thought this was the best choice. Pete wasn't willing to follow her so they split apart.

A few months later Bell quit smoking weed, starting a new life was difficult, meeting new people and making friends wasn't easy for her and there was no-one and anything to express all these problems to, her financial situation meant working 14-hour days before making a living from dancing and when it was time to relax she needed something stronger to take her mind away, so she migrated to stronger drugs. This, in relation to mental stress, led to her having symptoms of **SCHIZOPHRENIA**, hallucinations became stronger and stronger and she would hear voices constantly in her head, expressing her fears, her inner thoughts and insecurities.

The last thing that would challenge Bell was a strong insecurity of the past now grown stronger. As Bell hit 35 her body was not the same as before, she gained a bit of weight and would get rusty in her movement. Trying to become a dancer at that age was a challenge, competing with 20 year-olds meant comparing herself to younger girls with better bodies and more confidence. Her weight insecurity grew stronger than ever and **BODY DYSMORPHIA** started to haunt her.  



# Game 

Character is a witch (in her mind), though her magic is not flashy. She throws confetti and ribbons like a dance show. The environment is something dreamy, we are inside her mind. The basic-normal enemies are just simple black figures without details. 

At the start of the game she is old, around 40, and does not reveal much of who she is. 
**The game progresses in opposite order of the actual events. We start at the end (age 40) and end at the start (age 14), like remembering her past slowly following her footsteps backwards. So we as the viewer get to unwind the story and understand her.**
Moving on defeating "monsters" we learn things about her and the her past, what events and decisions made her who she is today, and defeating these challenges she unlocks new abilities and spells, and becomes younger (meaning more hp, speed and damage after every challenge)  

Game is 2D platformer like Ori or Hollow Knight. At first the movement is burdened (She walks relatively slow and like she is shy or old), she drags her feet, hunch over and breath heavily. Our character has only one attack (A/X - melee attack - does not need mana but very weak and close combat), she has HP and Energy-Mana. You need to deal damage in order to replenish mana like Hollow Knight Silk. Later after you unlock them energy is used for Running, Jumping and Powers. 
So she constantly needs to hit and engage in combat in order to replenish energy for abilities or movement (like an addiction)

Starting off after the tutorial she can see 4 doors (Labeled with markings that indicate the according challenge she will face inside) and in the middle a big gate, that is covered with black (grief) and red (rage) mist and cannot be accessed unless all of the other 4 challenges have been cleared. At the end of each challenge is a Boss fight.

These challenges are internal fights - demons, in order in which they appear and at what age they are first starting to become a real illness. Body Dysmorphia-35, Schizophrenia-30 , Addiction-25, Anxiety-20 and finally Grief/Rage-14



-------------------------------------------------------------------------

At first defeating Body Dysmorphia lets her move more freely and be more agile. (in game she is now fast, can run, jump and slide)

Then defeating Schizophrenia means she can think clear, and remembers more spells, she can use them now without second guessing herself (in game unlocks new powers - spells) 

After defeating Addiction she is free from needing to constantly replenish her energy (in game can store more mana and gains **passive mana regeneration** and now she does not need to fight to survive)

Lastly defeating Anxiety means she is more relaxed and clear-minded (has health regeneration and can **slow down time** - **focus**)

The final boss is Grief and Rage (Double boss fight like Ornstein and Smough) 
**Grief is fat, round and slow. While Rage is lean, has edges and corners and is fast**. (Inside out inspiration xd) Its the final boss cause it appears first in her life and also because its the hardest for her to accept and overcome
