HellBell

# Narrative

Bell is a woman defined by lost potential.

- **The Root:** Her father was strict and demanding (Source of **Anxiety** & **Rage**). Her mother was kind but mentally fragile and eventually took her own life (Source of **Grief** & genetic **Schizophrenia**).
- **Life:** Bell wanted to dance but was crushed by her father’s expectations. She retreated inward.
- **The Spiral:** After college, the pressure to survive led to **Addiction** (substances). By 30, the genetic **Schizophrenia** manifested as voices feeding her insecurities. By 35, she felt too old, heavy, and "wrong" to ever dance again (**Dysmorphia**).

# Game 

Character is a dancer. The environment is something dreamy, we are inside her mind. The basic-normal enemies are just simple black figures without details.  The purpose of the character is to deal with trauma inside her mind, she needs to face and overcome the mental challenges it takes in order to be free and herself.

**The game progresses in opposite order of the actual events. We start at the end (age 40) and end at the start (age 14), like remembering her past slowly following her footsteps backwards. So we as the viewer get to unwind the story and understand her.**


At the start of the game she is old, around 40, and does not reveal much of who she is.
Moving on defeating "monsters" we learn things about her and the her past, what events and decisions made her who she is today, and defeating these challenges she unlocks new abilities and spells, and becomes younger (meaning less hp, faster movement and attack speed but less attack damage after every boss battle)  

Game is 2D platformer hacknslash like Hollow Knight or Metroid. At first the movement is burdened (She walks relatively slow and while she tries can't jump yet), she drags her feet, hunches over and breathes heavily. Our character has only one attack (A/X - melee attack - does not need mana but  weak and close combat), she has HP and Mana. You need to deal damage in order to replenish mana like Hollow Knight Silk. Mana is used for Health Regen and special attacks, once you unlock them. 
But mana is slowly but constantly getting drained. So she constantly needs to hit and engage in combat in order to replenish mana (like an addiction)

Starting off after the tutorial she can only go one way, to the path that leads to the Dysmorphia boss fight.
After that she is able to jump so going back to the start she can progress to a new area. This leads her to the next boss which is Schizophrenia, which will let her use new attacks (heavy and light) and also wall jump. 
Wall jump unlocks yet another area that if explored will lead to the Addiction boss, which when defeated will stop mana from draining, and will also increase max mana and max health points.
Moving on she encounters Anxiety, and by surviving it she now has the ability to focus and slow down time.
Finally the last and only way leads to the final bossfight, Rage and Grief. 
After defeating the duo, the game ends and the only thing left is to walk back the way you came, returning to reality (waking up from your dream-mind) and realizing you won.
 
These challenges are internal fights - demons, in order in which they appear and what age of Bell's life they represent. Dysmorphia-35, Schizophrenia-30 , Addiction-25, Anxiety-20 and finally Grief/Rage-14

-------------------------------------------------------------------------


At first defeating Body Dysmorphia lets her move more freely and be more agile (in game she is now fast, can run, jump and slide). Dysmorphia is a figurine, like a deformed body to resemble the "perfect" body. (She might not even appear, the boss fight can also be environmental only).
This boss fight is just a movement challenge. There is a dark platform and a light and mirrors reflecting this light. Bell must dodge the light cause she will get damaged if seen, and she needs to break the mirrors and at the end the light source in order to defeat the challenge.


Then defeating Schizophrenia means she can think clear, and remembers more spells (in game unlocks new powers - spells). The boss is a short and black figure with a wooden mask.
This boss fight is a guessing game. Schizophrenia spawns decoys but only he should be damaged. If Bell hits the decoys she will get damaged and start from the first round, and if she hits the boss she moves to the next round, the rounds are with 1, 2, 4, 6 and finally 8 enemies. The only way to distinguish the decoys from the original is the fact that decoys don't cast shadows.


After defeating Addiction she is free from needing to constantly replenish her energy (in game can store more mana and gains **passive mana regeneration** and now she does not need to fight to survive). Addiction is a figure like a Dementor (HarryPotter).
This boss fight is survival. Addiction constantly drains your mana and you need to keep hitting it in order to replenish it, if Bell's mana runs out Addiction will start to deal damage instead. You need to follow it around as it flies and keep on hitting it to survive and win.


At the end defeating Anxiety means she is more relaxed and clear-minded (has health regeneration and can **slow down time** - **focus**). Anxiety is ... BLANK FOR NOW ...
Anxiety boss fight is just a bullet hell. Again Bell must survive a bullet hell, dodge all the incoming projectiles and damage the boss when possible, she must be calm and methodical with her movement.


The final boss fight is Grief and Rage (Double boss fight like Ornstein and Smough) 
**Grief is fat, round and slow. While Rage is lean, has edges and corners and is fast**. (Inside out inspiration xd) Its the final boss cause it appears first in her life and also because its the hardest for her to accept and overcome
Grief has enviromental attacks like slowing down the player or reducing visibility in the arena (all of his attacks will have dark-bluish tint), while Rage will be the one attacking, he attacks with a spear and can dash (and leaves a red-yellow mist behind him kinda like flash)

# Lore

Bell was an artistic child, one that growing up would spend time Drawing and Dancing and she wanted to become a dancer. She never tried pursuing it though as it meant disappointment and uncertainty in her father's eyes, and her not being comfortable with her body didn't help much. Unfortunately she was a shy kid, without many friends, and her father being himself, she didn't have anyone to express herself to. So all of her problems were shut down and not even thought after.
The first battle that she had to face was a strong one, and of course she wasn't ready for her mother's death, and her mind kept it a secret from her, she didn't want to know. You could almost see this cloudy, misty place inside mind that was locked off from the other part. Like a dark bad place no one is allowed to.

In college she had a hard time with **ANXIETY** for her studies and personal life. It made her quit whatever she was doing for herself and focus solely on her studies and career, thinking this was the key to the life she wanted. Later a friend from college, Pete, offered her an escape to help her relax, they would smoke weed together for the first time, which was relieving indeed. In college Bell and Pete got close and later got into a relationship. Bell for the first time had someone that she trusted, loved and cared for.
Over the next years they would smoke weed more and more frequently, Pete was her best friend and lover, the only one that cared for her and could accept her the way she was. 

Graduation led to a bunch of challenges. She had to now find a full-time job and support herself financially, she now needs to take care of herself. That's where an **ADDICTION** would spawn, she would smoke weed with Pete every day at night, knowing it wasn't good for her, but quitting would mean having to battle anxiety and address her current growing problems. At this time her father's death made her sad, but mostly it made her reconsider her life. She realised she does not need to fulfill his expectations, she should have chosen her own life from get go. Thus making her feel she needed to make a change in her life. Around this time Bell started experiencing memory loss and mild hallucinations but didn't think much of it yet.

Ultimately she did take an altering decision, she moved abroad, tried her luck elsewhere and pursued becoming a dancer, somewhere she can define her new self and not get shaped by other people's images of her. Since her world meant facing people, habits and problems of the past, she thought this was the best choice. Pete wasn't willing to follow her so they split apart.

Starting a new life was difficult, meeting new people and making friends wasn't easy for her and there was no-one and anything to express all these problems to. At the same time her financial situation meant working 14-hour days before making a living from dancing and when it was time to relax she needed something stronger to take her mind away. So a few months later she stopped smoking weed, but she migrated to stronger drugs instead. This, in relation to mental stress, led to her having symptoms of **SCHIZOPHRENIA**, hallucinations became stronger and stronger and she would hear voices constantly in her head, expressing her fears, her inner thoughts and insecurities.

The last thing that would challenge Bell was a strong insecurity of the past now grown stronger. As Bell hit 35 her body was not the same as before, she gained a bit of weight and would get rusty in her movement. Trying to become a dancer at that age was a challenge, competing with 20 year-olds meant comparing herself to younger girls with better bodies and more confidence. Her weight insecurity grew stronger than ever and **BODY DYSMORPHIA** started to haunt her.
